Dance Party
====================

This repo contains a fun in-browser dance party, complete with a secret easter egg you could probably figure out with relative ease.

I used this repo to explore JavaScript's polymorphism and subclass inheritance by making a bunch of dancers, inheriting some shared properties in addition to their own.

I used jQuery for some of the dancer behavior; it's included here as a dependency.
